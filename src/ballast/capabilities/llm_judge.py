"""LLM-as-a-Judge — runtime quality gate.

Thin wrapper around ``pydantic_evals.evaluators.llm_as_a_judge`` so the
same judge primitive that batches CI evaluations is also usable in the
hot path (after an agent turn, after a retrieval, after a tool-call
result). Production callers typically:

  - fire-and-forget (``sync=False``, default) — judge runs in the
    background, verdict is persisted/logged, the user-facing response
    is not blocked;
  - hard-gate (``sync=True``) — raise ``JudgeFailed`` on verdicts below
    ``threshold`` so the caller can route into HITL or retry.

``LLMJudge`` is intentionally a plain helper class, NOT a
``BallastCapability`` subclass. The judge grades arbitrary objects
(assistant turn, tool argument, retrieved chunk, intermediate plan) —
forcing it through pydantic-ai's capability lifecycle hooks would
conflate "the judging primitive" with "auto-grade on every turn".
Apps that want the latter wrap an ``LLMJudge`` instance inside a
capability of their own.

Two grading modes:

  - ``direct``   — single output graded against a rubric. Forwards to
                   ``pydantic_evals.judge_output`` /
                   ``judge_input_output_expected``.
  - ``pairwise`` — compare two outputs against the rubric, return the
                   winner. Pydantic-evals does not ship pairwise out
                   of the box; we own a tiny pydantic-ai Agent for it.

Verdict persistence is a separate opt-in helper
(``persist_verdict_as_thread_event``) — judges grade everything, but
only some callers want the verdict on the thread's event log.

         :func:`persist_verdict_as_thread_event`.
